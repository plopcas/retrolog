      <title>Developing Your Critical Thinking</title>

&lt;p&gt;Every day we need to make decisions as leaders. But this is often not easy. How can we improve our chances to make good decisions? There are many techniques for this, one of which is critical thinking. This technique is particularly effective, and it allows us to deconstruct the situation removing undesired bias and revealing hidden issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use critical thinking, rather than making a decision just because it feels right, you will scrutinise every available option and apply scepticism. Using the tools described below you will eliminate everything but the most useful and reliable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one way of approaching critical thinking based on 5 steps, as created by &lt;em&gt;Samantha Agoos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulate the question appropriately&lt;/strong&gt;: find out what you are really looking for. This is not always straightforward, as the real enquiry can be obscured by other factors. If the underlying question is not clear, you can try the &lt;em&gt;5 whys technique&lt;/em&gt; to identify the root of the problem at hand (ask why 5 times in a row to explore reasons deeper than the obvious and immediate ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather information&lt;/strong&gt;: having a clear idea of your question will help you determine what is relevant. You might ask an expert for their advise or seek other people&#39;s testimonies. This will help you weigh different options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply the information&lt;/strong&gt;: consider what concepts apply, be aware of what assumptions you are making and ask yourself if your interpretation of the situation is logically sound. By asking critical questions to yourself, challenging what you know about the problem, you will narrow down your alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the implications&lt;/strong&gt;: evaluate the consequences of choosing each option. Frequently, we tend to see only the short-term implications of our decisions, but it is important to consider the long-term impact as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore other points of view&lt;/strong&gt;: think about why other people prefer an alternative that is different from your preferred one at this point. Even if you disagree completely, this will help you understand why the rest of the options might appeal to others. This way you will explore alternatives, reconsider your own choices and ultimately make more informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one technique, and it will not remove the difficulty of making a decision. But it can help you increase the number of positive choices you make. Critical thinking can definitely help you navigate through a sea of alternatives and find what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving Your Conversational Skills</title>
      <link>https://retrolog.io/blog/improving-your-conversational-skills/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://retrolog.io/blog/improving-your-conversational-skills/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://retrolog.io/images/improving-your-conversational-skills.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, great communicators have an advantage. They know how to have great conversations. Personality helps, but this is a skill that anyone can learn. Here I explore a few tips to improve your conversational skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk slowly: if you are like me, you will tend to speak faster than you should, particularly when you have a lot to say. Typically, good talkers do not rush into a conversation. Take your time to think. You will be perceived as calmer and more centred. And you will help the other person &amp;ldquo;pace&amp;rdquo; their dialog too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the conversation at hand: do not multitask! You will hear the message more clearly when you focus only on the conversation. This shows respect, and when you give them undivided attention, they will respect you more as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not bring up controversial topics: there is a time and place for everything, but in general, your workplace is not good for controversy. Religion and politics are the most common ones. Even if you have strong views on particular issues, your goal is to respect everyone&#39;s different points of view. This kind of topics are best discussed with friends outside work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to nonverbal communication: for example, eye contact shows respect, nodding shows comprehension, facing them directly shows attention and focus, and leaning in demonstrates interest. Even when you are not speaking, your body language says a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the other person feel comfortable and confident: use positive questions to show interest and allow them to share their thoughts and expertise. Give them the opportunity to feel like an expert and explain what they have in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay positive even when you disagree: you could choose not to respond to their comment, but as a minimum be respectful. If someone is moaning about someone else in front of you, you might say that you are not sure you see the issue the same way, and focus on how to move forward. That way, even if you do not agree, you were not offensive to them either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this tips will help you take your conversation skills to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Providing Purpose</title>
      <link>https://retrolog.io/blog/providing-purpose/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://retrolog.io/blog/providing-purpose/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://retrolog.io/images/providing-purpose.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A job pays the bills. But if that is all it means to you, it will be hard to feel inspired. It is not unreasonable to expect a job to excite you and provide you with a higher sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purpose is feeling that your time is being well spent and your work is adding value to something that matters. For some people it is easier to feel purpose, and also some vocations are simply more likely to help you feel purpose e.g. teachers and healthcare professionals are frequently included in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most people are not wired to feel purpose that easily and most jobs are not clearly fulfilling in that sense. You, as a manager, have to effectively lead those people. What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can indeed create a sense of purpose. In order to do that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you will need to articulate the important goals they are serving beyond their daily work. This could be related to the community, or education, or environmental goals. It is too easy to get lost in the routine and miss the bigger picture your organisation serves. As a manager, your duty is to remind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you must find ways to link your employees to the outcomes of their work, e.g. if they create applications for students, show them feedback from real users. Or even better, invite some to the office so that they can share their experiences first hand. Anything that can help them feel the value they are adding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, give your team voice and autonomy. That is input in the decision-making process and freedom to be creative and not micromanaged. This will have the side benefit of improving trust and creating opportunities for development. But will also make people feel they are in control of their own time, making a genuine and invaluable contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some jobs it might be easier, but for any job, with a little effort, you can help people get over their routine and feel purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building Self-Awareness as a Manager</title>
      <link>https://retrolog.io/blog/building-self-awareness-as-a-manager/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://retrolog.io/blog/building-self-awareness-as-a-manager/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://retrolog.io/images/building-self-awareness-as-a-manager.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, it is hard to objectively self-evaluate their work and behaviours. Great leaders learn to build strong self-awareness. There are two main sources of information that can help you with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;personal-data&#34;&gt;Personal Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to learn about yourself, focusing on your strengths and weaknesses. You can achieve this by keeping track of your performance over time. There are three sources of data you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for a trend line that describes the evolution of your average performance in a period of time, maybe 6 or 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look also for your relative performance compared to other members of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, go back to your previous performance evaluations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;feedback-from-others&#34;&gt;Feedback from others&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the goal is to find at least one or two people that are willing to give you feedback. You will need someone more experienced than you for this, that has good exposure to your work, behaviours and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you know who they are, approach them in private and ask them from their perspective on you and your work. Try to be as respectful as possible, they are investing time and effort in giving you quality feedback after all. The golden rule is, make sure you let them talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;putting-things-together&#34;&gt;Putting things together&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to self-reflect on the data we can gather ourselves before asking others for their opinions. This way we will be more open to receiving feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this two or three times per year and you will have developed a deeper self-awareness that will help you improve faster at work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
